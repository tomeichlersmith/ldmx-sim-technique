# Muon Xsec Calculator
In order to debug the muon xsec calculation, we used this 
executable which was manually copied out of G4DarkBreM.

This executable only depends on Boost, so we can investigate
the xsec without worrying about confusion from Geant4.

### Compile and Run
```
make run label=my-label
```
