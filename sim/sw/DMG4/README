 The DMG4 package is intended for the simulation of Dark Matter production in the electron and muon beams. ALP particles production
by gamma can be also simulated, usually gammas are secondary particles produced in the above mentioned beams.

 The package structure:
 ----------------------

1. Subdirectory /src - package codes
   /DMG4 - DMG4 package codes
   /DarkMatter - DarkMatter package codes
   /UtilsDM - utility routines

2. Subdirectory /include - headers, the DMG4 headers are in a separate subdirectory /DMG4

3. Subdirectory DATA contains examples of files needed by Geant4 when some extension is used.

4. Subdirectory /examples contains examples of package configuration and of turning on the extension in a Geant4 application

5. Subdirectory /modules_cmake_standalone contains files to be used by CMake when CERN AFS is unavailable

6. configure - CMake helper script (wrapper)

7. runconfigure - example of using the configure script


 Steps to start work with the package DMG4:
 -----------------------------------------

 I. Preparation

1. Find Geant4 and GSL packages installed
2. Alternatively, install Geant4 yourself

 II. Compilation of the library

1. It is possible to use the lcg setup scripts, for example
   source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/setupViews.csh LCG_96b x86_64-centos7-gcc62-opt
   (use the first commented out line in the script runconfigure_lcg for information)
   This is a tested release, should be compatible with precompiled Geant4 described in the package "simulation"
   In this case simply use the script runconfigure_lcg or modify it to use your precompiled Geant4.
2. Manual configuration follows. Configure the compiler.
3. Configure cmake if needed
4. Choose a script runconfigure* or edit script runconfigure and run it or run the configure script manually
   (./configure --help for help). Note that the script runconfigure creates the file config.txt that can be used later
   when examples are compiled
5. make
6. make install

 III. Compilation of internal examples and user applications

1. example1 is a test of DarkMatter subpackage only. Run script runconfigure, then make. The executable is mkgeant4.
2. For your Geant4 application: compile it together with 3 libraries that are put in the subdirectory /lib when "make install" is executed
   Example of Dark Matter physics inclusion can be found in examples/mkgeant4.cc denoted by ""extension" part"
   Example of DarkMatterPhysicsConfigure.cc to simulate ALP is in examples/example1022
2. Before running the application set the environment variable G4ORDPARAMTABLE to one of the files in subdirectory /DATA
3. The DM mass and the threshold are to be set set in the file DarkMatterPhysicsConfigure.cc.
   You should tune BiasSigmaFactor0 in DarkMatterPhysicsConfigure.cc.
   In simulation, the cross section is biased by the factor BiasSigmaFactor. It is always
   equal to BiasSigmaFactor0 for the invisible mode (simulation performed for the benchmark epsilon 10^-4). In the visible mode
   simulation BiasSigmaFactor is automatically scaled if epsilon is different from 10^-4, so that the average number of DM per event
   is the same. The printed out Normalization is simply 1/BiasSigmaFactor.
