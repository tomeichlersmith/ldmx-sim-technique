18.03.2022   Version 1.2      Analytical expression for ds/dx in WW approximation is implemented for DarkZ (muon beam). Other improvements in DarkZ.
                              Small bugs fixed in K-factor tables. K-factors tables below 1 Mev extended for other DM types. This is the last version
                              before the major reorganization of the code.

06.09.2021   Version 1.1      Moved to using the analytical formula for the "flux" in the electron beams. Cross section drops because of this, it was
                              overestimated in the previous code because of a bug. Enable simulation of Dark Photons with the mass below 1 MeV.

30.06.2021   Version 1.0      Move to WW formulas in Muon Brems. process (Z' emission)

26.04.2021   Version Beta 3   All simulations are now made with correct Xmax. There is now maximal DM particle mass that can be simulated (1 GeV now)

31.03.2021   Version Beta 2   Fixed incorrect Xmax in differential CS (remained only for scalars, pseudoscalars and axials with mass > 20 MeV if decay is on)

22.02.2021   Version Beta 1   Initial version
