# Simulation-Level Comparison

The dark brem event libraries were generated by version 4.1 of dark-brem-lib-gen.
```
# setup dbgen environment and set cache/dest/work directories
dbgen use v4.1
dbgen run --nevents 50000 \
  --max_energy 100 \
  --min_energy 2 \
  --apmass 1 \
  --target copper \
  --lepton muon
dbgen run --nevents 50000 \
  --max_energy 4. \
  --min_energy 0.2 \
  --apmass 0.1 \
  --target tungsten \
  --lepton electron
```

Since the differences between DMG4 and MG-Sampling can be observed with relatively few events
(~10k minimum), I am going to avoid batch submission and simply generate the samples locally 
in sequence so that I have more control over them.

## Simulation Software
The [sw](sw) directory contains a lightened version of ldmx-sw using Framework and cmake along
with other modules copied over from ldmx-sw for further development.

## Documentation
We used DMG4 v1.2 released on March 18, 2022 and downloaded from [Mikhail Kirsanov's website](http://mkirsano.web.cern.ch/mkirsano/DMG4.tar.gz).
