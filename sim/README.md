# Simulation-Level Comparison

The dark brem event libraries have already been generated by version 4 of dark-brem-lib-gen.
`/hdfs/cms/user/eichl008/ldmx/dark-brem-event-libraries`.

I am going to use the batch submission infrastructure I have developed previously 
[UMN-CMS/ldmx-scripts/batch](https://github.com/UMN-CMS/ldmx-scripts/tree/main/batch). 
This requires some extra environment sourcing.
```
source /local/cms/user/eichl008/ldmx/umn-specific/ldmx-env.sh
source /local/cms/user/eichl008/ldmx/umn-specific/batch/condor_env.sh
```
Then I use `ldmx-submit-jobs` to submit jobs for each of the collections of dark brem event libraries.
```
ldmx-submit-jobs \
  -c config.py \ # should be in /local/
  -o sim-technique/ldmx \ # in contrast to dmg4
  -s ldmx_local_sim-technique.sif \ # should be in /local/
  -i dark-brem-event-libraries/<collection> \
  --no_recursive \
  --production \
  --files_per_job 1
```
