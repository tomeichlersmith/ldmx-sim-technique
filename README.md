# Sim Technique Paper Notes

Notes and code related to paper describing a new dark bremmstrahlung simulation integrated with [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/).

### Table of Contents
Each of the subdirectories serve a different purpose and contain their own documentation. 
The code for the dark brem simulation method described in the paper can be found in its own repository
[G4DarkBreM](https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/G4DarkBreM) and is pulled into this comparison repository
[within sim](sim/sw/).

- ana : scripts and notebooks for analyzing products of simulation
- sim : code for running either DMG4 or G4DarkBreM dark brem simulations within Geant4
