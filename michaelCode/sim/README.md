Files used to simulate dark brem emission and to calculate cross section using Weiszacker-Williams approximation or ETL + k-factor method. 
The dark brem process is contained within the DarkPhotons class, and must be initialized using a madgraph scaling file (either .lhe or .root) in order to generate emitted leptons. Test scripts which compile the class and calculate the cross section (cxcalc.cc) or create a sample of emitted muons (simulateEmuission.cc ) are included to demonstrate the use of DarkPhotons and to create inputs for plotting scripts. Sample commands to compile the test scripts are included at the start of their files.
